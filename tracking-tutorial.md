## Summary {#sec-summary}

This is a basic tutorial on how to track cells in Fiji [@Schindelin2012-di] using Mastodon [@Girstmair2025-qd]. The goals are to learn how to load and create Mastodon datasets, get familiar with navigating the BigDataViewer and TrackScheme windows, perform manual cell tracking with cell divisions and simple editing of lineages, perform semi-automated detection and tracking, and try some lineage analysis. We will use a demo Mastodon dataset [@Girstmair2024-iv] generated with lightsheet data from the isopod *Parhyale hawaiensis* [@Wolff2018-fr]. For more information and detailed instructions, please check Mastodon's [official documentation](https://mastodon.readthedocs.io/).

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/14-mastodon-window.png)

![](media/15-mastodon-project.png)

:::

- Navigate to the directory `Mastodon_Auto-Tracking_Demo_Ph-limb-dev/`.
- Select the file `Parhyale_LimbDev_30tps.mastodon`.

![](media/16-mastodon-open.png)

Several new windows will open (Console, Mastodon, BigDataViewer, TrackScheme, Data table).

![](media/17-mastodon-windows.png)

## Inspect the Dataset {#sec-inspect-dataset}

Let's focus on the Mastodon window.

- Close Console, BigDataViewer, TrackScheme, and Data table windows.

![](media/18-mastodon-main.png)

This is the main project menu from where we can open windows, set options, process data and save the project. The most important buttons for this tutorial are `bdv` (BigDataViewer) and `trackscheme`.

- Click on `bdv` and make the window larger.

![](media/19-mastodon-bdv.png)

- Drag the timepoint slider at the bottom to see cells moving and dividing.
- Using our acquired `BigDataViewer` skills, focus on the surface of the embryo.
- If you get lost, press `Shift+Z` to re-orient the embryo.
- Find a cell that divides before timepoint 15 and looks trackable and zoom on it using `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll`.
- Then center the view on it by holding the right button and dragging the mouse.
- Use `Shift+Scroll` to navigate through Z and `M`/`N` to go through time.

![](media/21-nucleus-after.png)

:::

We are ready to track.

## Manual Tracking {#sec-manual-tracking}

- On the Mastodon project window, click on the `trackscheme` button.

![](media/22-trackscheme-window.png)

The `TrackScheme` window will appear.

- Resize the `BigDataViewer` window to be side-by-side with the `TrackScheme`.
- Click on the `BigDataViewer` window, set the timepoint to some frames before mitosis, `Shift+Scroll` to find the center of the nucleus, put the mouse pointer there and press `A`.

![](media/23-manual-add.png)

A round magenta circle will appear over the nucleus and in the `TrackScheme`.

- With the mouse over the circle, use `Shift+Q` and `Shift+E` to adjust the size of the spot to roughly the nucleus diameter.

![](media/24-manual-resize.png)

- Zoom in on the new spot in the `TrackScheme`, hover and click on it and watch what happens in the `BigDataViewer` window.

![](media/25-click-spot.png)

- Go back to the `BigDataViewer`, hover the pointer over the circle and hold the spacebar to adjust the position of the circle and the nucleus.

![](media/26-adjust-position.png)

Now let's add a second spot.

- Hover the mouse inside the circle and hold `A`. This will advance to the next frame showing the first spot in white dashed line and the second spot in white solid line with a white solid link between the two.

![](media/27-hold-a.png)

- Still holding `A`, position the second spot, then release `A` to create the new linked spot.

![](media/28-release-a.png)

Check how the second spot and a link were created in the `TrackScheme` automatically.

- Continue to track the nucleus for a few more frames, until the frame immediately before division.

Note that when clicking on a spot in the `BigDataViewer` window, the corresponding spot is highlighted in the `TrackScheme` window.

- Now click on the spots in the `TrackScheme` and see what happens to the `BigDataViewer` (nothing will happen).

Let's change that and link the `BigDataViewer` and `TrackScheme` windows. In the menu bar of `BigDataViewer` and `TrackScheme` windows there are lock symbols `1`, `2`, `3`.

- Click on `Lock 1` in both windows.

![](media/29-lock-windows.png)

- Now click through spots in the `TrackScheme`.

![](media/30-locked-behavior.png)

The view in the `BigDataViewer` will change to show the selected spot at the center.

Before we continue tracking the cell division, let's check one of the amazing Mastodon features.

- Click on the `BigDataViewer` button in the Mastodon project window and another `BigDataViewer` window will open.

![](media/31-bdv-new.png)

- Now activate `Lock 1` and click on one of the `TrackScheme` spots.

![](media/32-bdv-sync.png)

Both windows will be synchronized!

Why is this useful for manual tracking?

- Adjust the view to center the spot in the second `BigDataViewer` window, press `Shift+Y`, and select a spot from the `TrackScheme`.

![](media/33-bdv-ortho.png)

We can have both XY and ZY views of the same nucleus! This is great for tracking in 3D. We can check, for instance, that our spot is well centered in Z and adjust it in this window.

![](media/34-bdv-division.png)

Continue tracking one of the daughter cells.

- Select the last spot in the `TrackScheme`, go to the XY `BigDataViewer`, hover the mouse over the circle and hold `A`, move the spot, and release `A` to add it.
- Do it for a few frames.
- Then go back to the pre-division spot and add a linked spot corresponding to the other daughter cell.

![](media/35-add-split.png)

This will create the first branch of the lineage tree.

- Continue tracking the second daughter cell for a few frames.

![](media/36-track-daughter.png)

- Zoom out the `TrackScheme` view to see the full branched tree.

![](media/37-tree-branch.png)

## Semi-Automated Tracking {#sec-semiauto-tracking}

This mode will try to guess where the next nucleus is and automatically create the spots and links.

- To start, choose a different nucleus to track and press `A` to add a new spot.

![](media/38-semi-spot.png)

- Now, hovering the pointer above the spot press `Ctrl+T`.

![](media/39-semi-auto.png)

A lineage will appear in the `TrackScheme`.

Check how accurate it is by clicking on the spots and watching their position relative to the nucleus in the `BigDataViewer` windows. Try going further with the semi-automated tracking.

- Hover a spot and press `Ctrl+T` to continue the semi-automated tracking.

![](media/40-semi-more.png)

See how long you can go, how it behaves with cell divisions, and which cells work well with it and which don't. There are many parameters that can be adjusted to tweak the semi-automated tracking behavior. Please check [Mastodon's documentation](https://mastodon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/partA/semi_automated_tracking.html) for more details.

## Automated Tracking {#sec-auto-tracking}

The final part of this tutorial is to try automatic detection and linking of spots. This is the dream: loading data and getting out a full lineage. However, in practice, it's a lot messier. Cleaning, fixing, and curating the data is required to get a nice informative lineage. We will use a simplified version of the protocol included in this demo dataset. It is described in the file `Protocol_Auto-Detection_Auto-Linking.docx`.

![](media/41-auto-doc.png)

### Detection {#sec-auto-detection}

- In the Mastodon window, go to `Plugins` > `Tracking` > `Detection...`.

![](media/42-auto-detect.png)

- Press `Next` twice (leave options as is).

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/43-detect-info.png)

![](media/44-detect-roi.png)

:::

- Choose `Advanced DoG detector` and press `Next`.
- Keep `Detect: bright blobs`.
- Change `Estimated diameter` to `35px`.
- Change `Quality threshold` to `100`.
- Keep `Behavior` as `Add`.
- Then, press `Next`.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/45-detect-dog.png)

![](media/46-detect-params.png)

:::

- Click `Preview` and see how well the detection will work by exploring a new `BigDataViewer` window.

![](media/47-detect-preview.png)

Are there too many false positives? Try changing the diameter, for example, and run the preview again to see what happens to the detected spots.

- Once satisfied, press `Next` and wait.

![](media/48-detect-run.png)

- When the detection is done, press `Finish`.

![](media/49-detect-done.png)

The `BigDataViewer` windows and the `TrackScheme` will be showing a lot of new spots.

- Explore the spots in the `BigDataViewer` and `TrackScheme` windows.
- Zoom in to see the unlinked, individual spots per frame.

![](media/50-detect-detail.png)

### Cleaning {#sec-auto-cleaning}

Before we try to automatically link these spots, let's remove low quality detections.

- On the Mastodon window click on `Table`, resize it to have more space, and resize the column `Detection q...` to show `Detection quality`.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/51-table-open.png)

![](media/52-table-resize.png)

:::

- Click on `Detection quality` to sort the table.

![](media/53-table-sort.png)

- Click on the first row to select it. Select all rows where `Detection quality` is `<400`.
- Then click `Edit` > `Delete Selection`.

![](media/54-table-delete.png)

- Close the table.

We can also manually delete obviously wrong spots by hovering and pressing `D`.

- Give it a try by cleaning up the spots outside the embryo.

### Linking {#sec-auto-linking}

Now let's try linking spots.

- In the main Mastodon window click on `Plugins` > `Tracking` > `Linking...`.
- Keep `All spots` selected for all timepoints (`0-29`) and press `Next`.
- Choose `Lap linker` and click `Next`.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/55-link-timepoints.png)

![](media/56-link-lap.png)

:::

- Change the parameters to:
  - `Frame to frame linking`: `Max distance` to `40px`.
  - `Gap closing`: `Max distance` to `60px` (keep others as is).
  - `Track division`: Check `Allow track division`, set `Max distance` to `40px`, and press `+` to add a `Feature penalty` and set it to `Center ch1` to `0.3`.
- Press `Next` to start linking and wait... then press `Finish`.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/57-link-params.png)

![](media/58-link-finish.png)

:::

Note that there are now tracks in the `BigDataViewer` and `TrackScheme` windows.

- Explore them a bit.

![](media/59-link-explore.png)

Mastodon can calculate features (position, displacement, velocity, etc.) of individual spots, links and branches. Let's do that.

- In the main Mastodon window press `compute features`.

![](media/60-compute-features.png)

A Feature calculation window will open.

- Press `compute` and wait... when it's done, close it.

![](media/61-computed-tracks.png)

Note that now the tracks in the `BigDataViewer` are showing colored links.

- Open the table window from the main window.

![](media/62-computed-features.png)

It'll be filled with computed features.

## Basic Feature Visualization {#sec-feature-visualization}

Finally, let's visualize the computed features that might be interesting or useful.

- In the `BigDataViewer` window press `File` > `Preferences` to open the feature color coding visualization parameters.

![](media/63-open-settings.png)

- On `Settings` > `Feature Color Modes` click on `Duplicate` (it'll generate a `Number of links (2)`) and then `Rename`.
- Rename it to `Velocity`.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](media/64-colormode-settings.png)

![](media/65-colormode-duplicate.png)

:::

- On the `Coloring Spots` change `Read spot color from` to `Incoming link` and change `Feature` to `Link velocity`. Then click on `autoscale` in the range.
- On the `Coloring Links` change `Read link color from` to `Link` and change `Feature` to `Link velocity`. Then also click on `autoscale`.
- Click `Apply` (nothing will happen), then `OK`.

![](media/66-colormode-params.png)

- On the `BigDataViewer` window press `View` > `Coloring` > `Velocity`.

![](media/67-velocity-apply.png)

The spots and links in the `BigDataViewer` window will change colors.

![](media/68-velocity-colors.png)

- Do the same for the other `BigDataViewer` window and the `TrackScheme`.

![](media/69-velocity-tracks.png)

This gives a visual representation of cells which have a high displacement per frame. These might be artifacts in linking unrelated spots or, in a good processed lineage, reveal some biological process like cell migration.

## Graph Plotting {#sec-graph-plotting}

To finalize, a simple example of plotting the lineage data.

- Click on `grapher` in the main Mastodon window, a plot window will open.

![](media/70-grapher-open.png)

- Press the `Lock 1` to lock the windows, select `Link velocity - outgoing` for X axis and `Detection quality` for Y axis and press `Plot`.

![](media/71-grapher-plot.png)

- Find out if the spots with the highest link velocity are properly linked or if it is an artifact.

![](media/72-grapher-analysis.png)
